# Host wikipedia on a local server. Just a few clicks to set up.

## Who is this for?

Are you setting up an IT system for your school with limited Internet access? Are you setting up an independent mesh networking community? Are you just a data hoarder? Then you probably would love to have your own local copy of Wikipedia.

Now, with Kiwix, you can easily set up your own copy of Wikipedia, Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, or many other open content sources with the ease that comes with Sandstorm.

## Who is this not for?

Kiwix is a project independent of this Sandstorm app. Sandstorm makes Kiwix easy to set up, however there are still some limitations to the Sandstorm version. These limitations will hopefully be fixed in future versions, but if they are important to you now, you may choose the standard <a href="http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Features#Web_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiwix web server</a>:

* Searching by document title should work, however searching by document content usually will not.
* External links must manually be opened in new tabs
* Opening internal links in new tabs may feel awkward for users

Also note that if you are running on somebody else's server (including Sandstorm Oasis) your storage quota may prohibit you from setting up some of the larger content (including Wikipedia)

## How does it work?

When you start up the app for the first time, it will guide you through the process:

* Get a content file from Kiwix's website (or somewhere else)
* Upload it into the Sandstorm grain
* Enjoy the content, and share it with others on your local network!
