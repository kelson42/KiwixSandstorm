# Wikipedia without the Internet. Just a few clicks to set up.

## Who is this for?

Are you setting up an IT system for your school with limited Internet access? Are you setting up an independent mesh networking community? Are you just a data hoarder? Then you probably would love to have your own copy of Wikipedia, available on your local network even when you're disconnected from the Internet.

Now, with Kiwix, you can easily set up your own copy of Wikipedia, Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, or many other open content sources with the simplicity of Sandstorm.

## Known Limitations

<a href="http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Features#Web_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiwix</a> is a project of its own. This Sandstorm app makes it easier to set up, but it is still in Beta, so some features may be rough around the edges:

* Searching by document content does not work for most wikis.
* Search does not work at all for some wikis (It does work for full English Wikipedia).
* The "Random Page" feature does not work.
* Seeking within videos does not work.
* External links must manually be opened in new tabs.

If you are interested in seeing something in particular get improved, <em>please give feedback</em>!

## How does it work?

When you start up the app for the first time, it will guide you through the process:

* Get a content file from the Internet
* Upload it to your local Sandstorm server
* Enjoy the content, and share it with others on your local network!
