# Host wikipedia on a local server. Just a few clicks to set up.

## Who is this for?

Are you setting up an IT system for your school with limited Internet access? Are you setting up an independent mesh networking community? Are you just a data hoarder? Then you probably would love to have your own local copy of Wikipedia.

Now, with <a href="http://kiwix.org/">Kiwix</a>, you can easily set up your own copy of Wikipedia, Wikiquote, Wikivoyage, or many other open content sources with the ease that comes with Sandstorm.

## How does it work?

When you start up the app for the first time, it will guide you through the process:

* Get a content file from Kiwix's website (or somewhere else)
* Upload it into the Sandstorm grain
* Enjoy your content!
