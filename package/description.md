# All of Wikipedia (and much more!) on your home or community server, in a few clicks

With Kiwix, you can set up _your own_ server to host a copy of many popular open data websites, in multiple languages, including:

* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) (and other [Wikimedia](https://www.wikimedia.org/) projects)
* [Project Gutenberg](https://www.gutenberg.org/)
* [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) (and other [Stack Exchange](https://stackexchange.com/) sites)
* [Ted Talks](https://www.ted.com/talks)

[See here](http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Special:MyLanguage/Content_in_all_languages) for all available content. To learn more about the Kiwix project (including how to install Kiwix directly onto your phone or desktop instead of Sandstorm) [see here](http://kiwix.org).

## What is this not?

This is _not_ wiki software, where anybody can edit the content. Once you download and install the content, it is read-only.

## Why do I want this?

You may find this useful if:

* You want to search and view content privately.
* You're just a [data hoarder](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/).
* You have Sandstorm set up in a low connectivity environment, and you want quick access to popular content.
* You are already a fan of the standalone [Kiwix server](http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Kiwix-serve), but you want the ease of use that comes with Sandstorm.

## Unsupported Features

Note that this Sandstorm app is based on the [Kiwix](http://kiwix.org) project, but is still in progress, so it may lag behind in some features. [See here](https://github.com/orblivion/KiwixSandstorm/blob/release/known_limitations.md) to read about current known limitations.

## How do I set it up?

When you start up the app for the first time, it will guide you through the process:

* Download a content file from the from Kiwix website (or elsewhere if you wish) onto _your personal computer_.
* Upload the content file from your personal computer into _your Sandstorm grain_.
* Enjoy the content, and share it with others who have access to your server!

## Licensing

[See here](https://github.com/orblivion/KiwixSandstorm/blob/release/README.md#license) for details on licensing, both for this app itself and bundled dependencies.
