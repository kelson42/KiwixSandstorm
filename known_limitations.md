# Known limitations

<a href="http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Features#Web_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiwix</a> is a project of its own. This Sandstorm app makes it easier to set up, but it is still in Beta, so some features may be rough around the edges:

## Searching:
* For some wikis, searching by document _content_ does not work.
  * Some, including English Wikipedia, may still allow search by document _title_, with autocomplete.
  * Search on some Wikis may not work at all.
* For some Stack Exchange sites, searching by document _content_ does not work.
  * Some, including English Stack Overflow, may still allow search by _tag_, with autocomplete.

## Other features:
* Seeking within videos does not work on some browsers.
* The "Random Page" feature on wikis does not work.
* Downloading books in PDF format in Project Gutenberg doesn't work.

## User interface:
* External links will not work unless they are opened in a new tab.

The hope is to get all of these things in order, but if you are interested in seeing something in particular get improved, _please give feedback_ so we know what to work on next!
