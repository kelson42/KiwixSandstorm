# Known limitations

<a href="http://wiki.kiwix.org/wiki/Features#Web_server" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kiwix</a> is a project of its own. This Sandstorm app makes it easier to set up, but it is still in Beta, so some features may be rough around the edges:

## User interface:
* External links will not work unless they are opened in a new tab.

The hope is to get all of these things in order, but if you are interested in seeing something in particular get improved, _please give feedback_ so we know what to work on next!
