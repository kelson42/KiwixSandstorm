This is a work in progress package of kiwix for Sandstorm. Since `kiwix-serve` is currently difficult to build from source, and it is expected to be easier in a couple months, this is going ahead by just downloading binaries from Kiwix's website. This should not be considered to be complete until it builds everything from source, or grabs everything from Debian packages (which may also be a possibility at some point).

See the TODO file to get an idea of the current status.
